# My journey to conquer LeetCode

Here I will occasionally post challenges that I solve on [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/). Some of the solutions may not be perfect. Intended for educational purpose only.

> Note: issues and pull requests are not accepted. Use discussion tab for comments and suggestions.

## Note on naming convention

Since I try to solve these challenges often enough I append a streak number to each solution. Streak is continuous solutions with one day break at most not counting days off.

XxYY-challenge-name.js \
where X - streak number, YY - day when the challenge was solved.
